# Profiles


The profile 01 was elaborated during the class, but I think there is an error on the end point of the first arc. 

[profile 01](./profile_01.gh)

I believe that profile 02 is correct. Maybe it's possible to simplify the equations.

[profile 02](./profile_02.gh)

In profile 03 I put the curves generation inside a Python component. ItÂ´s easier to understand, maintain and debug.
